## Problem
Telephone games like gartic phone are fun with friends, but it also can get stale. Can make game more refreshing
by adding new game modes, but eventually adding too much game modes makes it too confusing, usually the standard game mode 
is the best one anyways. Also, gartic phone doesn't have a single player option for playing without friends/strangers.

## Market
There is not much competition in telephone based drawing games, as it is mostly just Gartic Phone

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to create game sessions where I can invite my friends to have fun by making goofy drawings and text answers
2. As a user, I want to also have the option to play single player but not feel bored

## Stories that are less important
1. As a user, I want to have the option of joining public game sessions with strangers
2. As a user, I want to be able to report any player that is being inappropriate
3. As an admin, I want to be able to see reported players and their drawings, then decide if they get banned or not
